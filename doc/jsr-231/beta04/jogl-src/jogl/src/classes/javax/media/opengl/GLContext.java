/** Abstraction for an OpenGL rendering context. In order to perform
    OpenGL rendering, a context must be "made current" on the current
    thread. OpenGL rendering semantics specify that only one context
    may be current on the current thread at any given time, and also
    that a given context may be current on only one thread at any
    given time. Because components can be added to and removed from
    the component hierarchy at any time, it is possible that the
    underlying OpenGL context may need to be destroyed and recreated
    multiple times over the lifetime of a given component. This
    process is handled by the implementation, and the GLContext
    abstraction provides a stable object which clients can use to
    refer to a given context. */

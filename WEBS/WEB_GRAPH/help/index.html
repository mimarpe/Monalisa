	<a name="1"><b>1. How do I create a new chart?</b></a><br>
	<br>
	For each chart there is (at least) one <i>.properties</i> file that describes what needs to be plotted.
	These files are located in <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/conf</i>.<br>
	<br>
	There are many types of charts that can be created, for each one there is a sample configuration 
	file in that folder having each option explained.<br>
	<br>
	After you create a configuration file you can test it in the browser typing something like:<br>
	<i>http://localhost/display?page=your_new_file</i><br>
	Do NOT specify the <i>.properties</i> extension of the file name. The extension is automatically appended
	to the name you give as parameter.<br>
	<br>
	There are 3 servlets that handle your files:<br>
	<li><b>display</b>, that handles all the graphical charts</li>
	<li><b>stats</b>, shows the html (text) statistics</li>
	<li><b>genimage</b>, to display a map</li>
	<br>
	You can safely call <i>display</i> with any file as parameter, it will redirect the request to the proper servlet.<br>
	<br>
	To modify the tree structure you need to edit <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/tree1_nodes.js</i>. 
	<i>tree1_format.js</i> from the same folder controlls the aspect of the tree. To specify which nodes should
	automatically open when you load the page you must edit <i>leftp.html</i> that is in that folder too.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<a name="2"><b>2. I want to change the look of the pages. How do I do that?</b></a><br>
	<br>
	All the html code that is used to create the pages is located in <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/res</i>.
	When editing the <i>.res</i> files that contain the actual html code please make sure you don't 
	change the special tags (eg. the ones enclosed by <b>&lt;&lt;:</b> and <b>:&gt;&gt;</b>).<br>
	<br>
	You can add dynamic html code to some of your pages like this:<br>
	<li>edit <i>display/hist.res</i> or <i>display/rt.res</i> and enter a unique tag, we suggest something like <b>&lt;&lt;:page.content.1:&gt;&gt;</b></li>
	<li>in one/any <i>.properties</i> file add an option like:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>page.content.1=Some html code you want to add to that chart</i><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<a name="3"><b>3. Can I start only the storage client, without the web interface?<b></a><br>
	<br>
	Sure thing, edit <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/JStoreClient/njGlobal</i> and comment out the line <i>TOMCAT="true"</i> 
	and restart the repository. To enable the web interface again just uncomment that line and restart the 
	repository again.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a name="4"><b>4. How can I get the data from the repository?</b></a><br>
	<br>
	There are more ways of doing this:
	<li>You can directly extract the data from the database, but we don't recommend this. We already have three database 
	formats now and we don't guarantee there won't be some other format available in the future.</li>
	<li>You can use the WebServices interface that is automatically deployed with the repository. 
	To use this please take a look at some sample programs in <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/WS-Clients</i></li>
	<li>You can include the storage client in your own Java application. In <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/Embedded</i> is a 
	simple application that starts the MonaLisa client and waits to receive some data. For each data that
	matches some rules the value that was received and the average value in the last 30 minutes for that
	data are displayed.</li>
	<li>There is also a more direct method of connecting to the repository through TCP/IP, a sample code
	is provided in the <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/DirectClient</i> folder. Please take note that we <b>don't</b>
	recommend using this method to connect to the repository. The WebService is far more flexible for
	distance connections while embedding the repository in your application will provide the best 
	possible performance. But this method can have its uses too so feel free to use it if it suits your 
	needs.</li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<a name="5"><b>5. How can I put data into the repository?</b></a><br>
	<br>
	We recommend you to write MonALISA service modules and set the repository to store the data that is 
	produced by the service.
	But if you don't want to have a MonALISA service installed you can directly insert data into the repository.
	For this you have to write a script/program that writes on the standard output lines with the following format:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>FARMNAME CLUSTER NODE FUNCTION VALUE TIME</code><br>
	<br>
	<code>FARMNAME</code> : string<br>
	<code>CLUSTER</code> : string<br>
	<code>NODE</code> : string<br>
	<code>FUNCTION</code> : string<br>
	<code>VALUE</code> : double<br>
	<code>TIME</code> : longint (absolute time of the event in milliseconds, like <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code> from Java)<br>
	<br>
	The columns are separated by a single tab character (<code>\t</code>).<br>
	<br>
	A simple sample script that produces correct output:<br>
	<br>
	<pre><code>
	#!/bin/bash
	
	FARM=MyFarm
	CLUSTER=LoadAvg
	NODE=localhost
	TIME=`date "+%s"000`
	
	function process(){
	    echo -e "${FARM}\t${CLUSTER}\t${NODE}\tLoad5\t$1\t${TIME}"
	    echo -e "${FARM}\t${CLUSTER}\t${NODE}\tLoad10\t$2\t${TIME}"
	    echo -e "${FARM}\t${CLUSTER}\t${NODE}\tLoad15\t$3\t${TIME}"
	}
	
	process `cat /proc/loadavg`
	</code></pre><br>
	Now you need to modify the <i>App.properties</i> file located in <i>REPOSITORY_HOME/JStoreClient/conf</i>.
	You have to add/edit the following options:<br>
	<code>lia.Monitor.JStore.inserters=<i>N</i></code> : <i>N</i> is the number of scripts you have<br>
	for each script you have to define two options:<br>
	<code>lia.Monitor.JStore.execute_<i>X</i>.path=<i>/path/to/your/script.sh</i></code><br>
	<code>lia.Monitor.JStore.execute_<i>X</i>.time=<i>how often is this script run (in seconds)</i></code><br>
	<br>
	For example:<br>
	<code>lia.Monitor.JStore.inserters=2<br>
	<br>
	lia.Monitor.JStore.execute_0.path=/home/monalisa/MLrepository/bin/myscript.sh<br>
	lia.Monitor.JStore.execute_0.time=60<br>
	<br>
	lia.Monitor.JStore.execute_1.path=/home/monalisa/MLrepository/bin/myotherscript.sh<br>
	lia.Monitor.JStore.execute_1.time=120<br>
	</code>

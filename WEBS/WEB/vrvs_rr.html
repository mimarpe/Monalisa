<p><strong>Design issues</strong></p>
The ReflRouter client is able to provide an optimized dynamic routing of the videoconferencing 
data streams. This client requires information about the quality of the alternative connections in 
the system and it solves, in real-time, a minimum spanning tree problem to optimize the data flow at the global level. 
<br><br>
To evaluate the connection quality with possible peer reflectors we developed monitoring agents 
performing ping like measurements using UDP packages, which are deployed on all the MonALISA services. 
These agents perform continuously (every 4s) such measurements and with a selected set of possible peers, 
which can be dynamically reconfigured, for each reflector.  We are using small UDP packages to evaluate the 
Round Trip Time (RTT), its jitter and the percentage of lost packages. 
<br><br>
The best routing path for reapplication of the multimedia streams is defined as a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). 
This means that we need to find the tree that contains all the reflectors (vertices in a graph G) for which 
the total connection "cost" is minimized:
<center><img src="vrvs/MST_formula.gif"></center>
The "cost" of the connection between two reflectors (w) is evaluated using the UDP measurements from both sides. 
This cost function is build with an exponentially mediated RTT and if lost packages are detected or the jitter of 
the RTT is high the cost function will increase rapidly.   Based on these values provided by the deployed agents, 
the MST is calculated nearly in real - time. We implemented the Baruvka's Algorithm, as it is well suited for a 
parallel/distributed implementation.  Once a link is part of the MST a momentum factor is attached to that link. 
This is to avoid triggering reconnections for small fluctuations in the system. Such cases may occur when two possible 
peers have very similar parameters (or they may be at the same location).
<br>
<center><img src="vrvs/RR_state_diagram.gif"></center>
<br>
In order to be able to perform the rerouting of the multimedia packets, we have to know anytime the status of 
the Reflectors, their peer links and the quality of their links with a set of "neighboring" reflectors. 
<br><br>
Currently, we do not monitor all Reflectors in the VRVS system, and therefore, Results containing peer links 
that are not found can be received. These links are ignored and no routing is performed with them. The condition 
to perform routing with just a part of the reflectors and not affect the functioning of all system (i.e. not 
make cycles) is that the <i>monitored reflectors be the backbone of the VRVS</i>. Cycles could be produced if, for 
example, we would monitor two reflectors that are leaves in the VRVS tree (the system would issue commands to 
connect these two reflectors, being unaware that they are already connected through other reflectors).
<br><br>
<p><strong>Implementation issues</strong></p>
The peer links are in fact tunnels over the Internet. They are kept in a hashtable "tunnels" in each ReflNode, 
the key being the name of the peer Reflector. The available links with the other reflectors are also considered tunnels 
and are kept in the same class (IPTunnel). IPTunnels have a set of attributes. They have <tt>peerQual</tt> 
(if it is an active tunnel) and <tt>inetRTTime</tt> - the result from ABPing (if the peer is in the list of 
the nodes for the current reflector). These values have an associated time - the time when last information about 
that peer was received. This way, we can get an expiring time for each type of link and issue critical rerouting commands.
<br><br>
Each tunnel has two attributes referring to its state: <tt>crtState</tt> and <tt>nextState</tt>. The current state of 
a tunnel can be either <tt>ACTIVE</tt> or <tt>INACTIVE</tt>, if it currently is in the tree of selected tunnels or not. 
This attribute depends on the age of the <tt>peerQual</tt> attribute, and is checked (and possibly modified) each 
time the status of this tunnel is requested by the MST algorithm. The <tt>nextState</tt> attribute is set by the MST 
algorithm and can have multiple values: <tt>ACTIVE</tt>, <tt>INACTIVE</tt>, <tt>MUST_DEACTIVATE</tt> or <tt>MUST_ACTIVATE</tt>.  
The MUST_* states can be set before running the MST algorithm to select the tunnels that either must or must 
not be active anymore, as we will se later. The first two states are set by the MST algorithm and they usually mean 
states that are recommended for optimizing the overall cost of the tree.
<br><br>
The <tt>ReflRouter</tt> is a class that extends <tt>TimerTask</tt> in order to be invoked from time to time to 
optimize the tree. But usually it is necessary to react to certain events, like a reflector becomes active or inactive. 
Each 20 seconds (by default, but this value can be changed editing the <i>ml.properties</i> file) all reflectors 
are checked. This includes checking all tunnels. If a reflector or tunnel isn't active anymore, a rerouting is 
triggered.  This happens also when a reflector becomes active and it must be included into the MST.
<br><br>
<p><strong>Setting the Restrictions for the MST algorithm</strong></p>
There are some critical cases that must be analyzed before running the MST algorithm. For this, each 
ReflNode is checked. If a node isn't active then it must not appear in the MST. Further, the tunnels that 
start from the inactive node must also not be present in the computed tree. Therefore, the next state 
will be set to <tt>MUST_DEACTIVATE</tt>. If the node is active, then each link to the other 
reflectors (either active peers or neighbor reflectors) is checked. If the peer reflector isn't 
active the respective tunnel must not be active. 
<br><br>
Another problem arises when between two reflectors there is no ABPing information, or there is only 
one ABPing link. In this case, the state of the both peer links depends on the current status 
of the peer link. If there is at least one peer link, then both must be activated. If none is 
active, then no peer link must be active.
<br><br>
For the other cases the next state of a tunnel is initialized as <tt>INACTIVE</tt>, 
and the MST algorithm will set it as needed.
<br><br>
<p><strong>The MST algorithm</strong></p>
The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph defines the cheapest subset of edges that keeps 
the graph in one connected component. The input is a graph G = (V,E) with weighted edges. 
The problem is to find the subset E' of  E of minimum weight forming a tree on V.
<center><img src="vrvs/MST_trees.gif"></center>
For implementation, we used the Boruvka's algorithm, as it is also appropiate for a parallel implementation. 
<br><br>
The original Borvuka algorithm is:
<pre>
       Given G = (V,E)
       T = graph consisting of V with no edges
       while T has < n-1 edges do
          for each connected component C of T do
             e = min cost edge (v,u) s.t. v in C and u not in C
             T := T union {e}
</pre>
<br><br>
But there can be a problem if the graph isn't connex. In this case, there is no way to connect n-1 edges, 
so that condition is modified such that the while cycle repeats as long as there is at least one union made into the for cycle.
<br><br>
In our case, while joining subtrees, we also mark the next state of each tunnel that is used to perform the respective joint as <tt>ACTIVE</tt>. 
<br><br>
Another modification that must be done to this algorithm is that the process is going to be running interative, i.e. 
we compute the MST, issue commands to change the tree, then we compute the MST and change the tree again and so on. 
A problem that could appear is that of  active links oscillation.
<br><br>
<center><img src="vrvs/MST_oscillations.gif"></center>
<br>
For example, as in the above figures: at moment t1, the link between B and C is worse and therefore, is inactive; 
at the next moment, the link between A and C is worse and the algorithm would issue the commands to deactivate 
link A-C and activate instead the B-C link; but at the third moment, link between A and C is better once more 
than B-C, ant the algorithm would send new commands. This would be very bad for a system where there are live 
conferences ongoing. Therefore, we must take care and issue the commands for changing the route only when 
the new route is much better than the current route. 
<br><br>
This problem can be solved by setting an inertial factor for the links belonging to the MST. Links that are currently 
in the MST have an artificial cost lowered by, for example 20%. It is important to give this value relative, 
not absolute as the cost of the links can vary very much - for example links between the reflectors in the same LAN 
have very low cost, compared to those separated by oceans. Using this inertial factor we are sure that the 
oscillations cannot happen very often, and that when a new link is chosen, it will bring an semnificative improvement in quality.
<br><br>
It's worth saying that this algorithm runs in O(m log n), where m is the number of edges and n the number of vertexes.
<br><br>
<p><strong>Generating commands sent to the Reflectors</strong></p>
Having the MST algorithm complete, we have to send the needed commands to the reflectors in order to change the 
current network topology to be as the one calculated. There are two types of commands: <i>critical</i> and <i>optional</i> 
commands. A command is considered critical when it must be sent to the reflectors; its next state is 
either <tt>MUST_ACTIVATE</tt> or <tt>MUST_DEACTIVATE</tt>. There is one more situation when the commands must 
be sent: the number of links to be deactivated differs from the number of links to be activated. In this case, 
it means that there are reflectors with only one peer link between them - the other must be activated, 
or the one that is active must be deactivated and one of the reflectors must be connected by some other 
path to the others. The optional type of commands refers to modifications that can be made in order to optimize 
the overall cost of the tree. It is only recommended to send these commands to the reflectors.
<br><br>
For each activation command, there is a tunnel that must be activated. Similarly, for each deactivation 
command, there is a tunnel to be deactivated. There is always a list of tunnels that are currently in 
the tree; the MST computes another list of tunnels to be in the next tree. Selecting the links that are in 
the current list of tunnels but not in the next, gives the list of tunnels to be deactivated; selecting 
tunnels that are in the next tree, but not in the current tree, gives the tunnels to be deactivated. 
<br><br>
<p><strong>Output from ReflRouter</strong></p>
The ReflRouter client was tested simulating that the commands were sent to the reflectors. 
For this, the previous tree was saved and when the algorithm was rerun, the current tree was 
initialized to that. The same algorithm (and classes) was used in the GUI client to perform the MST. 
Using the graphical interface and seeing the costs of the links the correctness of MST could be easily 
checked. More tests were performed running more instance of the ReflRouter on different machines, 
in different places. The algorithm issued the same commands no matter where it was run. We encountered 
problems with the links oscillations, but that were solved as explained above.
<br><br>
Here is the output generated at some rerouting event:

<font size="+1"><strong class="page_subtitle">Data Collection</strong></font>
<p>
The data collection part is based on a multithread engine that performs the procedures 
to get the requested values. A monitoring module performs a certain task (a SNMP request, 
runs a script or a performance program) and it can be dynamically loaded into the system 
and applied to a (set of) system(s)  with a defined frequency. Dedicated modules to use 
parameters collected with other monitoring tools (e.g. Ganglia, MRTG) are controlled  
by the same multithread engine. 
</p>

</p>

<p> A <strong>Monitoring Module</strong> is a dynamic loadable unit which 
executes a procedure (runs a scrip / program or performs SNMP request) 
to collect a set of parameters (monitored values) by properly parsing 
the output of the procedure. In general a monitoring unit is a simple 
class, which is using a certain procedure to obtain a set of parameters 
and report them in a simple, standard format. Each monitoring module must 
implement a method that provides the names (identifiers) for the parameters 
is able to collect. </p>

<p>Monitoring Modules can be used for pulling data and in this case it 
is necessary to execute them   with a predefined frequency or to "install" 
(has to run only once) pushing scripts (programs) which are sending the monitoring 
results (via SNMP, UDP or TCP/IP) periodically back to the Farm Monitoring module.  
The execution for these modules is done using a dynamic  pool of threads and it 
controlled by the farm monitoring unit.  Allowing to dynamically load these modules 
from a (few) centralized sites when they ate needed makes much easier to keep 
large monitoring systems updated and provide new functionalities dynamically. 
</p>

<p>The <strong>Farm Monitoring</strong> unit is responsible for the configuration 
and the monitoring of one or several farms.  It can dynamically load any monitoring 
modules from a (set of) http servers or a distributed files system and use them 
to perform monitoring tasks on each node based on the configuration it receives from 
a RC Monitor unit. </p>

<p>The dynamic pool of threads is used to run the specified monitoring modules on 
each node.  This allows to run concurrently any number of modules and to efficiently 
use the resources. If performing a monitoring task fails or hangs due to I/O errors, 
the other tasks are not delayed or disrupted if such a multi-thread scheme is used. 
A dedicated control thread is used to stop the threads in case of I/O errors and to 
reschedule these tasks that have not been successfully done. A priority queue is 
used for the jobs that need to be executed  periodically. 
</p>
<br>
<font size="+1"><strong class="page_subtitle">The Service System</strong></font>

<p>Each farm unit may register as a JINI service and / or WSDL service. Clients or 
other services can get the system configuration and are notified when a change is done. 
Access to monitor parameters is done using a predicate mechanism. Clients can subscribe 
with a predicate  which may  return  historical data  and / or perform a subscription 
for the matching values in the future.   The monitoring predicates are based on regular 
expressions for string selection, including configuration parameters (e.g. system 
names.parameters), conditions for numerical values and time limits.   In addition 
predicates may perform elementary functions like MIN, MAX, average, integral. 
The predicate matching and the client notification is done in independent threads 
(one per client IP) under the  control of the DataCache unit.  Measured values are 
currently stored into a relational DB using JDBC (InstantDB,  MySQL, Postgres , 
Oralcle ...). The query procedures are adapted to the predicate mechanism for 
selecting historical data and at the same time to provide active listeners. 
</p>

<p>More complex data processing can be done using  Filter Agents.  They are "active 
objects" which  may be deployed by a client or an other service to perform a dedicated 
task using the data collected from a farm unit. It use a predicate to receive the 
data it needs and may send the computed values back a set of  registered units.  
As an example, a maximum flow path algorithm can be done by such an agent. Agents may 
perform such tasks without  being deployed to a certain service but in this case the 
Data Cache unit needs to send all the requested values to a remote site.

<ul>
	<li>The system allows to add dynamically additional data writers and provide the 
	collected values to other programs or tools.</li>
	<li>The Monitor Farm unit is design as a service system able to accept values, 
	predicate based requests from clients and Agent Filters and to manage all of them asynchronously.</li>
	<li>The service is than  "published" as a JINI service and a WSDL service at the same time.</li>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.jini.org" title="JINI" target="_blank">JINI</a></strong> extends the Java Platform 
providing support for Distributed Applications. JINI is a set of Java classes (APIs) and services 
within a distributed computing framework. The purpose of the JINI architecture is to federate 
groups of software components into a single, dynamic distributed system. The major features 
which make JINI technology attractive  are: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lookup Discovery Service</strong>: Services are found and resolved by a lookup 
	service. The lookup service is the central bootstrapping mechanism for the system and 
	provides the major point of contact between the system and users of the system. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>Leasing Mechanism</strong>: Access to many of the services in the JINI system 
	environment is lease based. A lease is a grant of guaranteed access over a time period. 
	Each lease is negotiated between the user of the service and the provider of the service 
	as part of the service protocol. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>Transactions Manager</strong>: Reliable distributed object models require 
	transaction support to aid in protecting the integrity of the resource layer. The specified 
	transactions are inherited from the Jini programming model and focus on supporting large 
	numbers of heterogeneous resources, rather than a single large resource (database). This 
	service provides a series of operations, either within a single service or spanning multiple 
	services that can be seen as distributed atomic procedures having a two-phase commit. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>The JavaSpaces Service</strong>: This communication mechanism was heavily 
	influenced by the concept of a Tuple space that was first described in 1982 in a 
	programming language called Linda. Distributed programs, unaware of each other's existence, 
	can communicate by releasing data (a tuple) into a persistent space. Programs read, 
	write, and take such entries from the Tuple space that are of interest to them. The  
	distributed JavaSpace implementation  developed by  Gigaspaces will be used for the data 
	management system using the real-time monitoring  services. 
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Web services</strong> are software components that can be invoked across a network 
using XML. They are building blocks for building distributed applications in language, platform 
and location independent way.  A service-oriented architecture implements each part of the a 
systems as a web service. Simple web services provide low-level features such as access to 
particular kind of data or to perform a data processing task. Higher-level web services 
orchestrate lower-level services to provide more complex behaviors, resulting in a pyramid 
or increasingly specialized processing. </p>
<p>Three standards support the implementation of web services: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>WSDL</strong> (web services description language) is the XML equivalent of 
	a resume. WSDL describes what a web service can do, where it resides, and how to invoke it.</li>
	<li><strong>SOAP</strong> (service-oriented access protocol) is a general-purpose protocol 
	for sending XML messages between endpoints, and may be used for remote procedure calls 
	(RPC) or plain document transfer. SOAP messages can be send over any transport layer; 
	HTTP is the most common layer, with implementations also available for Simple Mail 
	Transport Protocol (SMTP) and Java Messaging Service (JMS). </li>
	<li><strong>UDDI</strong> (universal description, discovery and integration) is a registry 
	for connecting producers and consumers of web services. A producer can use the UDDI 
	publish API to register information about a web service, and a consumer can use the UDDI 
	inquire API to locate one or more web services that satisfies a particular criteria. </li>
</ul>

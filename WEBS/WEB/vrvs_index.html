<p>For each VRVS reflector, a MonALISA service is running using an embedded Database, for storing the results 
locally, and runs in a mode that aims to minimize the reflector resources it uses (typically less than 16MB 
of memory and practically without affecting the system load). </p>
<p>Dedicated modules to interact with the VRVS reflectors are developed: to collect information about the 
topology of the system; to monitor and track the traffic among the reflectors and report communication errors 
with the peers; and to track the number of clients and active virtual rooms. In addition, overall system information 
is monitored and reported in real time for each reflector: such as the load, CPU usage, and total traffic in and out. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="vrvs/ML_service_and_refl.gif" border="0"></p>
A dedicated GUI for the VRVS version of MonALISA client was developed as a java web-start client.  
This GUI provides real time information dynamically for all the reflectors which are monitored. 
If a new reflector is started it will automatically appear in the GUI and its connections to its peers will be shown. 
Filter agents to compute an exponentially mediated quality factor of each connection are dynamically deployed to 
every MonALISA service, and they report this information to all active clients who are subscribed to receive this information.
<br><br>
It provides real-time information about the way the VRVS system is used (number of conferences or clients) 
the topological connectivity of the reflectors and the quality of it and system related information (IO traffic CPU load).  
Clients can also get historical data for any of these parameters.
<br><br>
The subscription mechanism allows one to monitor in real time any measured parameter in the system as all the updates are 
dynamically displayed on the open windows. Below are some snapshots of the GUI client.

<p>Details of the system are presented in Catalin Cirstoiu's Diploma Thesis:<br>

<p><strong>Number of clients and virtual rooms</strong></p>
A reflector always keeps track of the current connected users. This information can be 
gathered by making a TCP connection to the reflector on a certain port and issuing a 
command. The reflector will return on the same connection the information requested 
and then it will close the link. The received text is parsed and we get:
<ul>
<li>	number of audio clients;</li>
<li>	number of video clients;</li>
<li>	number of virtual rooms.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Peer links for a Reflector</strong></p>
Peer links represent the current active tunnels for a reflector. The reflector forwards 
packets to the other reflectors based on users and virtual rooms information (a packet 
from a user in a certain virtual room must reach all users in the same virtual room 
wherever they would be in the whole system). For each tunnel, we can query the reflector 
for the following data, which is forwarded to the listeners:
<ul>
<li>	quality of the link, as computed by the reflector software;</li>
<li>	lost packages.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Links quality evaluation - monABPing</strong></p>
In order to be able to supply a routing alternative for the current selected tunnels, 
we have to monitor links' qualities between reflectors. For each reflector a set of 
possible peers is chosen and the module monitors the quality of each link. The module 
sends UDP packets to the other reflectors. The other reflectors respond sending back the 
received packet. This way we can determine simple, but important factors that influence 
the quality of each link. The quality is computed with the following formula:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	RTimeQuality = OVERALL_COEF + RTT_COEF * rtt + PKT_LOSS_COEF * loss% + JITTER_COEF * jitter
</p>
This formula is flexible enough to permit calculating any kind of quality, based on RTT, Packet Loss and Jitter. 
The values obtained by pinging peers are:
<ul>
<li>rtt - the round trip time for packets to travel to the peer and back;</li>
<li>loss - percent, ranging from 0 to 1 of lost packets sent to the peer;</li>
<li>jitter - sum of the variations of rtt for a set of samples, divided by the average rtt and number of samples. </li>
</ul>
The list of available peers for each reflector and the *_COEF coefficients should be highly 
configurable to allow easy reconfiguration. To reach this goal, the configuration file is the 
same for all reflectors, each one knowing to extract only the information that is needed. 
The coefficients must be the same for all reflectors in order to obtain comparable RTime qualities.
<br><br>
The configuration file is loaded at start, and then it is periodically checked, from a URL 
configured when starting MonALISA service on the reflector. If there is a new peer for a 
reflector, it is added to the list of peers in the monABPing module. Similarly, if a 
known peer isn't found anymore in the configuration file, it is deleted from the peer list. 
If at least one of the coefficients modify, all measurements are reset and the 
new values are computed using the previous formula.
<br><br>
Here is a sample configuration file:
<pre>vrvs.co.pub.ro vrvs-eu.cern.ch vrvs-us.cern.ch
vrvs-eu.cern.ch vrvs-us.cern.ch vrvs.co.pub.ro cinxia.tv.funet.fi
vrvs-us.cern.ch vrvs-eu.cern.ch vrvs.co.pub.ro vrvs-starlight.cern.ch
…
OVERALL_COEF 0
RTT_COEF 0.5
PKT_LOSS_COEF 100
JITTER_COEF 20

# We keep last RTT_SAMPLES rtts (integer value)
RTT_SAMPLES 10

# The history of Lost Packages is PKT_LOSS_MEM long (integer value)
PKT_LOSS_MEM 20

# The size of the packet sent over the net (must be > 3 bytes)
PACKET_SIZE 450

# Time between pings (ms). Should be big enough to allow reasonable 
# time for packets to return to sender and not consider them lost
PING_INTERVAL 4000
</pre>

<p><strong>Filter based data analysis</strong></p>
A filter is, generally speaking, both a client and a data producer for other clients 
of the MonALISA service. As a client, a filter receives all data from the monitor modules. 
It analyzes this data and performs an action according to the received data. As a 
data producer, it generates Results for other clients.
<br><br>
For monitoring Reflectors, the MonALISA service must be started using two filters:
<ul>
<li>Filtering data - TriggerAgent
	<ul>
		<li>Register for receiving the data coming from the modules</li>
		<li>Compute time mediated values for peer links quality:<br>
			<i>Qual2h, Qual12h, Qual24h</i>
		</li>
		<li>Build a special type of result, "alarm" if there is no data from 
		    the reflectors for 1 minute
		</li>
		<li>Inform all registered clients</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Triggering Actions - vrvsRestartTrigger
	<ul>
		<li>Listen for receiving the data from the modules</li>
		<li>Take action if no interesting data comes ...<br>
			&nbsp;for 1 minute ==> restart reflector<br>
			&nbsp;for 2 minutes ==> send e-mail/sms to a list of administrators
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

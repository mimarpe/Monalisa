Client developed using Apache Axis for the "MLWebService".
Invoking the "getValues" function of the MLWebService.

Apache Axis is an implementation of the SOAP (Simple Object Access
Protocol).  

The "getValues" operation interrogates the database for getting
parameter results. It takes as input farm name - the name of the farm 
interested in, cluster name -the name of the cluster intrested in, node 
name - the name of the node interested in, parameter name - the
parameter name interested in, from time and to time - the return results 
will be those that were received in the database between these moments of time
(given in milliseconds). The return value is complex schema type, an array of
results.

This client is called from the command line running the following scripts:
     - ./generate_classes - generate classes from service wsdl file;
                            The tool used for generating the needed classes
			    is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
			    return and parameter complex types  starting
			    from the wsdl service description file.
			     
     - ./compile_classes - compile client classes
     - ./run_client "*" "*" "*" "*" -999900000 0 - in this case the service URL will be
    						   taken from the environment variable
						   MONALISA_WS;
        or
       ./run_client "*" "*" "*" "*" -999900000 0 "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch:8080/axis/services/MLWebService"    	

and will return the results from all the farms ("*") - the first argument,
all the clusters ("*") - the second argument, all the nodes ("*") - the
third argument, all the parameters ("*") - the forth argument, that were 
registered in the database between the fifth argument and the sixth argument.

Another example 

./run_client  "*" "*" "*" "DataTag0_OUT" -999900000 0 "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch:8080/axis/services/MLWebService"
and will return the results from all farms ("*") - the first argument,
all the clusters ("*") - the second argument, all the nodes ("*") - the
third argument, the "DataTag0_OUT"  parameter  - the forth argument, that were 
registered in the database between the fifth argument and the sixth argument.

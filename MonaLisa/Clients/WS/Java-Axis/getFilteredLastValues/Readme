Client developed using Apache Axis for the "MLWebService".
Invoking the "getValues" function of the MLWebService.

Apache Axis is an implementation of the SOAP (Simple Object Access
Protocol).  

The "getFilteredLastValues" operation interrogates the database for getting
the last received results. It takes as input farm name - the name of the farm 
interested in, cluster name -the name of the cluster intrested in, node 
name - the name of the node interested in, parameter name - the
parameter name interested in. 

The return value is complex schema type, an array of results.

This client is called from the command line running the following scripts:
     - ./generate_classes - generate classes from service wsdl file;
                            The tool used for generating the needed classes
			    is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
			    return and parameter complex types  starting
			    from the wsdl service description file.
			     
     - ./compile_classes - compile client classes
     - ./run_client "*" "*" "*" "*" - in this case the service URL will be
    				      taken from the environment variable
				      MONALISA_WS;
        or
       ./run_client "*" "*" "*" "*" "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch:8080/axis/services/MLWebService"

and will return the last known results from all the farms ("*") - the first argument,
all the clusters ("*") - the second argument, all the nodes ("*") - the
third argument, all the parameters ("*") - the forth argument.

Another example 

./run_client  "*" "Master" "*" "Load5" "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch:8080/axis/services/MLWebService"
and will return the last known results from all farms ("*") - the first argument,
from the cluster named "Master" - the second argument, all the nodes ("*") - the
third argument, the "Load5"  parameter  - the forth argument.

Client developed using Apache Axis for the "MLWebService".
Invoking the "getLastValues" function of the MLWebService.

Apache Axis is an implementation of the SOAP (Simple Object Access
Protocol).  

The "getLastValues" operation returns the latest data received by
the client, one value for each parameter that is received. This function
has no parameters and returns an array of results.

This client is called from the command line running the following scripts:
     - ./generate_classes - generate classes from service wsdl file;
                            The tool used for generating the needed classes
			    is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
			    return and parameter complex types  starting
			    from the wsdl service description file.
			     
     - ./compile_classes - compile client classes
     - ./run_client 
       or
       ./run_client "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch:8080/axis/services/MLWebService"

If you don't specify the URL of the WebService then the default localhost address is used.

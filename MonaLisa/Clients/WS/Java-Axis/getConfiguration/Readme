Client developed with Apache Axis for the "MLWebService" web service.
Invoking the "getConfiguration" function of this service.

Apache Axis is an implementation of the SOAP (Simple Object Access
 Protocol).

The "getConfiguration" operation interrogates the Monalisa database 
for getting farms configurations. It takes as input two moments of 
time ( "fromTime" and "toTime" ) in milliseconds and returns all 
the configurations from the database that were registered between 
the given moments of time. The return value is complex schema type, 
an array of configurations.

This client will return an array of configurations received in the database
in the last week.
You can call this client running the following scripts:
    
     - ./generate_classes - generate classes from service wsdl file; 
    			    The tool used for generating the needed classes
			    is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
			    return and parameter complex types  starting
			    from the wsdl service description file. 
     - ./compile_classes - compile client classes
     - ./run_client <url of the service>
         or
       ./run_client - in this case, the <url of the service> will be taken
                      from the environment variable set from the "install.sh"
		      script.	 
    
    where the argument from the command line represents the location of the 
    axis service MLWebService. 
    For example: 
    "./run_client "http://monalisa-starlight:8080/axis/services/MLWebService"
     or
    "./run_client"

Client example using WSIF for accessing "MLWebService" web service.
Invoking the "getValues" function of the "MLWebService" through a 
 high level stub interface.

	  
WSIF (Web Service Invocation Framework) is a simple Java API  
 for invoking Web services, no matter how or where the services 
 are provided. WSIF is closely based upon WSDL, so it can invoke 
 any service that can be described in WSDL.
 	  
Find documentation about Apache WSIF from its site:
          "http://ws.apache.org/wsif/		   
	 
    The "getValues" operation interrogates the database for getting
parameter results. It takes as input farm name - the name of the farm
intrested in, cluster name - the name of the cluster intrested in, node
name - the name of the node interested in, parameter name - the parameter
name interested in, from time and to time - the return results will be
those that were received in the database between these times ( given in
milliseconds). The return value is complex schema type, an array of results.

For executing the examples run the following scripts:
 - ./generate_classes -  generate classes from service wsdl file;
                          The tool used for generating the needed classes
                           is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
                           return and parameter complex types  starting
                           from the wsdl service description file.
 - ./compile_classes  - compile the client classes
 - ./run_client <farm_name> <cluster_name> <node_name> <param_name> <fromTime>
                <toTime> <wsdl file location - optional>
           - executes the client; if the location of the wsdl file is not specified,
	     it will be taken from the environment variable MONALISA_WS.
				       
  For example: ./run_client "*" "*" "*" "*" -99990000 0
					       
  will return all results from all farms ("*"), all clusters ("*"),
  all nodes ("*"), all parameters ("*") registered in the database between from time (-99990000)
  and to time (0 - present).

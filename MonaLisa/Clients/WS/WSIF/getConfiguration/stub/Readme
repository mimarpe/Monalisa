Client example using WSIF for accessing "MLWebService" web service.
Invoking the "getConfiguration" function of the "MLWebService" through a 
 high level stub interface.
 
WSIF (Web Service Invocation Framework) is a simple Java API
  for invoking Web services, no matter how or where the services
  are provided. WSIF is closely based upon WSDL, so it can invoke
  any service that can be described in WSDL.

Find documentation about Apache WSIF from its site:
           "http://ws.apache.org/wsif/
	     
The "getConfiguration" operation interrogates the Monalisa database
for getting farms configurations. It takes as input two moments of
time ( "fromTime" and "toTime" ) in milliseconds and returns all
the configurations from the database that were registered between
the given moments of time. The return value is complex schema type,
an array of configurations.

This client return the configurations registered in the database
in the last week.

For executing the examples run the following scripts:
 - ./generate_classes -  generate classes from service wsdl file;
			 The tool used for generating the needed classes
			 is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
			 return and parameter complex types  starting
			 from the wsdl service description file.
 - ./compile_classes  - compile the client classes;
 - ./run_client <wsdl location>      - executes the client; if the location
			 of the wsdl file is not specified, it will be taken
			 from the environment variable MONALISA_WS.

Client example using the Apache WSIF for accessing "MLWebService" web service.
Invoking the "getConfiguration" function of the "MLWebService" using the WSIF's
 dynamic invocation interface.
 
  WSIF (Web Service Invocation Framework) is a simple Java API
  for invoking Web services, no matter how or where the services
  are provided. WSIF is closely based upon WSDL, so it can invoke
  any service that can be described in WSDL.
 
 Because the "DynamicInvoker" can invoke only services with primitive
 schema types, this WSIF tool was not used in this case.
  
 Find documentation about Apache WSIF from its site:
          "http://ws.apache.org/wsif/

The "getConfiguration" operation interrogates the database 
for getting farms configurations. It takes as input two moments of 
time ( "fromTime" and "toTime" ) in milliseconds and returns all 
the configurations from the database that were registered between 
the given moments of time. The return value is complex schema type,
an array of configurations.

This client return the configurations registered in the database
in the last week.

For executing the examples run the following scripts:
 - ./generate_classes -  generate classes from service wsdl file;
                         The tool used for generating the needed classes
			 is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
			 return and parameter complex types  starting
			 from the wsdl service description file.
			 
 - ./compile_classes  - compile the client classes;
 - ./run_client <location of the wsdl file - optional> 
       - executes the client; if the location of the wsdl file is not specified,
         it will be taken from the environment variable MONALISA_WS.

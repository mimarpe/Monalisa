Client example using WSIF for accessing "MLWebService" web service.
Invoking the "getLatestConfiguration" function of the "MLWebService" through a 
 high level stub interface.
 
 WSIF (Web Service Invocation Framework) is a simple Java API
  for invoking Web services, no matter how or where the services
  are provided. WSIF is closely based upon WSDL, so it can invoke
  any service that can be described in WSDL.
  
 Find documentation about Apache WSIF from its site:
          "http://ws.apache.org/wsif/


The "getLatestConfiguration" operation interrogates the database 
for getting the latest configuration for a given farm. It takes as input 
one parameter, the farm name. The return value is complex schema type.

For executing the examples run the following scripts:
 - ./generate_classes -  generate classes from service wsdl file;
                         The tool used for generating the needed classes
			 is "WSDL2Java" which generates Bean classes for
			 return and parameter complex types  starting
			 from the wsdl service description file.
- ./compile_classes  - compile the client classes;
- ./run_client <farm name> <wsdl location - optional> - executes the client;
			 if the location of the wsdl file is not specified, it will
			 be taken from the environment variable MONALISA_WS

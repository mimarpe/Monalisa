This document describes the "MLWebService" web service. 
This web service was developed using Apache Axis.

Apache Axis web site from:
   http://ws.apache.org/axis
   
Apache Axis is an implementation of the SOAP (Simple Object Access
   Protocol).

Service description:

The service offers a single port type with three operations: "getValues", 
"getConfiguration" and "getLatestConfiguration".

 
    - Result[] getValues (String farmName, String clusterName, String nodeName,
			  String parameterName, long fromTime, long toTime);
			  
	 This function interogates the database and gets all the
	 parameters and parameters values from the farm, cluster and node spe-
	 cified and the time when these parameters were registered was between
	 "fromTime" and "toTime".
	 
	 The return value is an array of "Result" objects. The Result class is a
	 Bean class and has the following important fields:
	 
	    public class Result	{
		
		String farmName; //farm name.
		String clusterName; // cluster name.
		String nodeName; // node name.
		String[] param_name; // parameter names
		double[] param; //values of the parameters
		long time; //the absolute time when the Result was registered
			   //in the database.
			   
		..... // Result get/set functions	   
		
	    } //class	 
	    
    - WSConf[] getConfiguration (long fromTime, long toTime);
         
        This function interogates the database and gets all the configu-
	rations received between "fromTime" and "toTime".
	The java classes that describes a configuration is the WSConf class. These 
	classes are Bean classes. The  fields of these classes are:
	
	    //The java class that describes a farm configuration
	    public class WSConf { 
		private WSFarm wsFarm; // the farm that had this configuration
		private long confTime; // the time when this configuration was registered in
			       // the database
		..... // set/get functions	       
	    }  		    
	    
	    //the java class that describes a farm
	    public class WSFarm {
		private WSCluster[] clusterList; // the clusters of this farm
		private String farmName; // the name of the farm.
		..... // set/get functions
	    }
	    
	    //the java class that describes a cluster
	    public class WSCluster {
		private String clusterName; //the name of this cluster
		private WSNode[] nodeList; //the nodes of this cluster
		..... // set/get functions
	    }
	    
	    //the java class that describes a node
	    public class WSNode {
		private nodeName; // the name of the node
		private String[] paramList; // the list of parameters for this node
		..... // set/get functions
	    }
	    
    - WSConf getLatestConfiguration (String farm) 
	
	This function returns the latest configuration received from the specified
	farm. 
	The "farm" argument must be specified. If it is null, the function returns
	an error message.

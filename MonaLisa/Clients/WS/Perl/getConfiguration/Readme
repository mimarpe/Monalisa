Client developed using Perl module Soap::Lite for the "MLWebService" web service.
Invoking the "getConfiguration" function of this service.

Soap::Lite for Perl is a collection of Perl modules which provides a
simple and lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP), both on client and server sides.

For this example it was also used the Time:HiRes Perl module. 
The Time::HiRes module implements a Perl interface to the usleep,
ualarm, and gettimeofday system calls.  This allows for very
precise timing measurements inside of Perl scripts. 

The "getConfiguration" operation interrogates the database for 
getting farms configurations. It takes as input two moments of time 
( "fromTime" and "toTime" ) in milliseconds and returns all the 
configurations from the database that were registered between the given mo-
ments of time. The return value is complex schema type, an array of 
configurations.

This client will return an array of configurations received in the database
in the last week.
You can call this client with the following command :

    ./Client.pl  "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch:8080/axis/services/MLWebService?wsdl"
    
    or
    ./Client.pl - in this case the location of the wsdl file will be taken from the 
                  environment variable "MONALISA_WS".

Client developed using perl module Soap::Lite for the "MLWebService".
Invoking the "getValues" function of the MLWebService.

Soap::Lite for Perl is a collection of Perl modules which provides a 
simple and lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol 
(SOAP) both on client and server sides.   

Command line arguments:
    - farm name - string;
    - cluster name - string;
    - node name - string ;
    - parameter name - string ;
    - from time - long;
    - to time - long;   
    - URL location of the MLWebService wsdl file
       For example:
       "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch/axis/services/MLWebService?wsdl";


The "getValues" operation interrogates the database for getting 
parameter results. It takes as input farm name - the name of the farm 
interested in, cluster name - the name of the cluster intrested in, node 
name - the name of the node interested in, parameter name - the parameter 
name interested in, from time and to time - the return results will be 
those that were received in the database between these moments of time 
( given in milliseconds). The return value is complex schema type, an array
of results.

This client is called from the command line with the following command:

./Client.pl  "*" "*" "*" "*" -999900000 0 "http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch/axis/services/MLWebService?wsdl"

and will return the results from all the farms ("*") - the first argument,
all the clusters ("*") - the second argument, all the nodes ("*") - the
third argument, all the parameters ("*") - the forth argument, that were 
registered in the database between the fifth argument and the sixth argument.
The location of the service is specified as the last parameter.

Another example 

./Client.pl   "*" "*" "*" "DataTag0_OUT" -999900000 0 

and will return the results from all the farms ("*") - the first argument,
all the clusters ("*") - the second argument, all the nodes ("*") - the
third argument, the "DataTag0_OUT" parameter  - the forth argument, that were 
registered in the database between the fifth argument and the sixth argument.
The location of the service wsdl file will be taken from the environment variable 
MONALISA_WS.

If you have previously installed v09x for MonALISA,
we recommend to update to v1.0

To start a MonaLisa service you should read the
README under Service

To start a GUI Client go to Clients/Gui please visit
http://monalisa.cacr.caltech.edu/

You should have Java Web Start installed.


====================================
How to upgrade from v09x
====================================

After you have unpacked the distribution from the site
(http://monalisa.cacr.caltech.edu/) please follow these
steps:

1) Go to ${MonaLisa_HOME}/Service and copy the entire TEST
directory into a new directory ( same name as your previously ${FARM_HOME} ).
$cd MonaLisa.v1.0/Service
$cp -r TEST <your_farm_name>

2) Edit ml.properties in your farm directory according to your previously values
(Location, SNMP_community, etc). Please fill the contact informations( your name and email)

3) Copy your farm.conf file from MonaLisa.v09x into your new $FARM_HOME

4) Go to CMD directory and edit ml_env with the same values as v09x. The only difference is
a new variable MONALISA_USER, which must be set to the username that will run MonALISA.

 From v1.0 MonALISA will not run as root ( by default ). Please edit MONALISA_USER with
 the username that will run MonALISA. MonALISA does not require root privileges so it's
 better to run it from a normal account.

IMPORTANT
=========

 If you have autoupdate enable please update your crontab with your new path to MonALISA.
 Use the ./ML_SER stop to stop MonaLisa.v09x

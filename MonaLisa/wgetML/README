This directory contains a simple script to 
update MonALISA in case there are http proxy
issues at your site, or you want to download ML
binaries.

All you have to do is:

$cd MonaLisa/wgetML
$./getML.sh

The entire operation will be logged in wgetML.log

It also includes a script which "tests" if the .jar files
are ok.


Requirements
============

You should have installed zip and wget.

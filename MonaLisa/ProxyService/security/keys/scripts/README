Requesting a host or service certificate
----------------------------------------

1) ./genKey alias_example

This will create the keystore (MLService.ks) containing the keypair used in authentication process.
The parameter 'alias_example' will be used as an alias for the keypair in keystore

!!! When you are prompted to introduce your name fill this field with your host IP such as:
    host/<your_host_IP_address>

These is necessary in order to pass the authorization check made by the Lookup Service.


2) ./certRequest alias_example cert_request.csr

This will generate an certificate signing request from keystore MLService.ks
The resulting 'cert_request' file must be submitted to us for signing. 
See http://monalisa.cern.ch/CA/ for details.

3) After receiving the certificate signing response use the following script to import it in your keystore

./importCert CA_name  password_example ca_cert.pem
./importCert alias_example password_example signed_certificate.pem


After these steps the file MLProxy.ks contains your private key along with a signed certificate for the public key.

4). Create a file named MLProxy.password with the keystore password and "chmod" it for your own

echo "password_example" > ../Service/MLProxy.password
chmod 600 ../Service/MLProxy.password

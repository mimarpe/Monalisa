    1. DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL THE SERVICE AS ROOT!

    2. Make sure no running program is listening on the
ports that postgres and tomcat are (or will be) using. 
The default ports are 5544 for postgres and 8080 for tomcat.
You can change the default configuration using the files in
conf/ dir. Please check these files before trying to install
the repository.

    3. Run install.sh. Should an error had occured please
untar the package, correct the error and try again.
    The install.sh script will look up the java home dir.
If java cannot be found in current path then the script asks
for one and tests it.
    The java home dir and the repository dir are saved
in conf/ directory in the env.JAVA_HOME and env.REPOSITORY_DIR
files.

    4. Start the service using start.sh. You can control 
every service in part using scripts/*.sh
    
    5. Test the web service typing http://localhost:8080/ 
in your browser's address bar. You should start seeing some
values in the charts in a few minutes.

    6. To stop the service you can use stop.sh. Please add a
reference to scripts/verify.sh in your crontab, for example:

* * * * * ~/MLrepository/scripts/verify.sh &>/dev/null

This script checks if the repository is running ok, if not
the repository is restarted.

    7. To change the path to java home dir in the future
please edit the conf/env.JAVA_HOME. You can move the
entire repository to another directory but you have to
edit the conf/env.REPOSITORY_DIR and write the new path
there.

    8. This repository contains some Web Services Client
examples. They are default configured to use the localhost
as the web server to which they connect to. To change this
behaviour please edit the conf/env.MONALISA_WS file. When
you edit this file make sure there is no trailing line feed
character at the end of the line.

    9. After you start the repository please check the
documentation provided under the "Site config" menu.

    10. You can keep your repository updated by running the
update.sh script. Before running this script please BACKUP 
YOUR REPOSITORY. The script should correctly update the
service and the additional software (database, web server etc)
and it shouldn't cause any problems at all, but it's better
to have a backup in case something doesn't work as planned.

Instead of using this script you can download the latest stable
version from the site and manually update the components. If you
proceed like this you should keep at least the following folders:
./pgsql_store/data
./JStoreClient/conf
./conf
./tomcat/webapps
./tomcat/conf   	(or at least modify the new tomcat config
                         files to use the same tcp/ip ports)

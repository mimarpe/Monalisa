1.2.92: 2008/10/29
    * For a long time the changes were not logged, too much has changed to be told :)

1.2.27: 2005/03/14
    * JFreeChart 1.0.0-pre2
    * OverLib tooltips

1.2.24: 2005/02/15 (lots of changes&fixes in the meantime, major ones following)
    * PostgreSQL 8.0.1 as the default database
    * Java 1.5+ support (external libraries upgrade)
    * Dynamic buffer size is autoadjusted according to the JVM memory limit
      parameter

1.2.15
    * (2004/09/01) Added ApMon statistics reporting to the repository

    * (2004/08/28) Added a dynamic buffer for the data that is stored, this 
      will make things work faster in both repository and the service.

    * (2004/08/27) Some minor fixes related to DirectInsert methods.

    * (2004/08/24) Added WS function calls statistics on the info.jsp page.

    * (2004/08/20) Stats fixes : green instead of red when there are some values
      but they are =0. Added "bool2" option that displayes orange when the
      values are =0.

    * (2004/08/19) Several fixes and optimizations in the storage and averaging 
      structures.
    
    * (2004/08/11) Added PostgreSQL storage to the repository, writemodes 7&8,
      and changed the default storage to mode 7 and two 1-year tables (1min and
      100min-averaged values). MySQL storage is still available for the old
      repositories.

    * (2004/07/15) Made the buffered data flush to disk if it stays too long
      in memory (especially usefull for rare data that didn't appear on the
      history charts but until two values of that kind where received)

    * (2004/07/13) Changed the default INNODB buffer size to 32M instead of 8M

1.2.14
    * (2004/07/12) Fixed the Start and Stop scripts for MySQL and changed the
      default MySQL port number to 3316.
    
    * (2004/07/10) In maps, the nodes that don't have some specific data but that
      nodes in fact run ML and report some data:
        default.alternate_data=<predicate>
	or
	NODENAME.alternate_data=<predicate>
	
	we are using this option like this:
	default.alternate_data=$NAME/*/*/-1/-1
	
    * (2004/07/09) The status pages can now display the row number at the left of the
      series name:
        option<set number>.numbers=true

    * (2004/07/08) Added smoothing support for automatic detection of starting value
	history.smooth_from_table=<table_name>
    
    * (2004/07/01) Added URLs support for history charts:
	url.format=<string>
	
      You can use the following special symbols in the string:
        {T}	- current table

	{SS}	- point time in millis
	{SD}	- point date as string (yyyy-mm-dd)
	{ST}	- point time as string (hh:mm:ss)
	
	{ES}	- now, time in millis
	{ED}	- now, date as string
	{ET}	- now, time as string
	
	{V}	- value
	
	{ID}	- table id for this series
	
	{S}	- series name

    * (2004/06/26) Added shapes support for each series in a history chart
      The options are:
	default.shape=[o^v#-|]		(the default is 'o')
	SERIESNAME.shape=[o^v#-|]
	
    * (2004/06/24) "Smoothing" support. There are cases where the data should be incremental
      but the counters are sometimes reset. This filter ignores the decreases in
      values and consideres only the increases.
      To activate this filter just add:
        history.smooth_sets=true
      to your configuration file for a history chart.
      You can also specify a starting value and a starting date, this value will
      be added to all the data having timestamp > starting date.
	history.smooth_startdate=<long, time in millis, default 0>
	history.smooth_addvalue=<double, default 0>

    * (2004/06/20) History series can now have arbitrary combinations of Farm,Cluster,Node and
      Function. If you need this behaviour just add to your history chart config.
      file :
        series.names=Name,Name...
	series.predicates=Farm[/Cluster[/Node[/-1[/-1[/Function]]]]],...
      both options need to have the same number of values, separated by ","
	
      For example:
        series.names=Load5,Load10
	series.predicates=TestFarm/*/*/-1/-1/Load5,TestFarm/Master/*/-1/-1/Load10

      Or, if the farm was given as the http variable named "farm" :
        series.predicated=${farm}/Master/*/-1/-1/Load5 ...

    * (2004/06/20) Statistics page can now display green/red cells if there is some recent data
      for a given predicate or not. Also an arbitrary string can be displayed,
      such as a result from a query...
      
      Example:
        #The Farms
        pivot0_2=${Farms}
      
        # the predicates 
        pivot0_3=$2/*/*,\
	         $2/Master/*,\
		 $2/PN%,\
		 $2/VO_JOBS,\
		 $2/VO_IO,\
		 $2/ABPing,\
		 $Qselect version from abping_aliases where name='$2' limit 1
	
	# column header names
	descr0=Online,\
	       Master,\
	       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,\
	       VO_JOBS,\
	       VO_IO,\
	       ABPing,\
	       ML Version
	
	# how should the predicates' results be displayed
	func0=last ns;bool,\
	      last ns;bool,\
	      last ns;bool,\
	      last ns;bool,\
	      last ns;bool,\
	      last ns;bool,\
	      string

1.2.13 - bad luck collision avoided

    * (2004/06/16) Initial release of ChangeLog file

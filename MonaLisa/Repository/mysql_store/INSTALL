Quick Launch:

1) Set MYSQL_HOME in Start_Mysql.sh and InitMonaLisa.sh to the directory were you unpack this
distro.

2) cd $MYSQL_HOME.

3) cp -r Conf/.MyCC/ ~/.MyCC

4) ./Start_Mysql.sh

5) if OK ./InitMonaLisa.sh

You must have about 120MBytes (for the current settings) free on the partition
where you intend to install Mysql. InnoDB alocates it's tables at the very first
start of Mysql.

You have an very intuitive client GUI for configuring your users/passwords. It's
called mycc(see http://www.mysql.com/products/mycc/index.html). You should find
it in mysql_store/mycc.

To create default tables layout please use mycc:
$MYSQL_HOME/mycc/mycc
(In step 3 you have copied the default configuration params for mycc)

The script is in Conf/MonaLisa/crebas_InnoDB.sql

Default user&pass:
mon_user
mon_pass

If you already have a mysql daemon running in the system and you want to bind
this one on a new TCP port, other than standard 3306, you should change the
value MYSQL_TCP_PORT to whatever value you want.

For more config options please read the Start_Mysql.sh

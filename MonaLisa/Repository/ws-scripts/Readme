This package contains examples of clients for calling "MLWebService" 
web service.

The clients can interrogate both the MLWebService from the Repository and the 
MLWebService from the MonALISA service.

The examples were developed using Apache Axis, Apache WSIF and Perl 
SOAP::Lite modules. 
The examples developed with Apache Axis are located in the WS-Clients/Java-Axis
directory, those developed with Apache WSIF are in the WS-Clients/WSIF directory 
and those developed with Perl SOAP:Lite modules are in the WS-Clients/Perl directory.

Every client example calls a function of the MLWebService and is located in a 
subdirectory having the name of the called function. The source of every example
is called "Client" ("Client.java" or "Client.pl"). There are special scripts
in each directory for automating the installation of used libraries, the generation
of used classes , the compilation of the classes and the execution of the client.

Installation specifications:
    First of all, the "install.sh" script must be executed. this script sets the 
    environment variables for running the examples. It sets JAVA_HOME (java location)
    and MONALISA_WS (the location of the MLWebService that the user wishes to 
    interrogate).
    
    ( There can be found a MLWebService running at the following location:
	"http://monalisa-starlight.cern.ch:8080/axis/services/MLWebService" )
    
    Then, for every client example, execute its scripts (see Readme from each 
directory).

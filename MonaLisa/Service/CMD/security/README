How to to enable your Monalisa service to register in secured LUSs?


1) If the machine running the Monalisa service already have a private/public key-pair 
(i.e Globus host credentials: /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem and /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem)
the following steps must be performed:

    1.1 Change the <monalisa_home>/Service/CMD/getPrivateKey and <monalisa_home>/Service/CMD/getCertificateChain scripts to match
        the location where credentials can be found.
        
    1.2 Contact your system administrator and ask him to add these scripts in "sudoers" list of accepted scripts to be run 
	with root privileges. (this step is necessary since private key file is only readable by root)

----OR-----

2)Generate Public/Private Key Pair for your Monalisa Service

    2.1 ./csr - generate the private key and the certificate signing request
    [!] For CommonName field use your host IP such as:
        host/<your_ip_address>
        This is used in host authorization when the service registers in LUS

    2.2 Send the service.csr to your CA for signing.
	The Certificate Authoriy must be trusted by the LUSs services you plan to register into.

    2.3 After you received the signed certificate file (servicecert.pem) place it along with your private key file
	(servicekey.pem) in your ML farm dir (<FARM_HOME>/servicecert.pem and 
	<FARM_HOME>/servicekey.pem)
	
    2.4	Set in the ml.properties file the following entries in "Register in secured LUSs" Section:
	
	    lia.Monitor.useSecureLUSs = true
	    lia.Monitor.login.sourceForKeys = files
	    #these files have to be readable by monalisa user
	    lia.Monitor.login.privateKeyFile = servicekey.pem 
	    lia.Monitor.login.certChainFile = servicecert.pem

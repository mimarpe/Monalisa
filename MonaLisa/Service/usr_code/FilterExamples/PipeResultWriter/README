This directory includes a simple example of a Filter
which can write all the (e)Result-s based on a set of
predicates defined in a configuration file, into a 
Unix pipe. The "filtered" (e)Result-s are kept in a 
circular buffer.

The configuration file is monitored for modification time
and any changes in this file are reloaded by the filter, 
without the need to restart the service.

1) compile the code using the ./comp script ( in the same directory )
  
2) enable the filter. edit the ml.properties file and add the
following entries:
    
    a) add the directory to the class loader
	lia.Monitor.CLASSURLs=file:${MonaLisa_HOME}/Service/usr_code/FilterExamples/PipeResultWriter/
	 
    b) enable the filter
        lia.Monitor.ExternalFilters=PipeResultWriter
	     
    c) set the configuration file for the filter
	PipeResultWriter.ConfigFile=${MonaLisa_HOME}/Service/usr_code/FilterExamples/PipeResultWriter/conf.properties

3) Define the path to the named pipe used by the filter (PIPE_NAME 
parameter) in the configuration file defined at step 2. 
 
 *Note* This must be the full path to the named pipe. ( It does not recognize
 env variables like $MonaLisa_HOME
		   
		   
All the configuration parameters are explained in conf.properties file

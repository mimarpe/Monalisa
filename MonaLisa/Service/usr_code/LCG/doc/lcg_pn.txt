 1. General Description
----------------------------------------
The PN modules offer monitoring information about the processing nodes 
from a cluster. The metrics provided are a subset of the Ganglia metrics
(see section 3), but the information is obtained from a job manager running on
the cluster instead of Ganglia. Currently the modules work with Condor and 
OpenPBS/Torque and the commands used to obtain the nodes' status are:
  - for Condor: condor_status -l
  - for OpenPBS/Torque: pbsnodes [-s <server_name>] -a


--------------------------------------
 2. Compiling and Running the Modules
----------------------------------------
In order to use the PN_LCG_Condor and PN_LCG_PBS modules, you should have MonALISA 
1.2.38 or newer.

If you have the OSG distribution and put the modules in your folder in urs_code
folder from Monalisa/Service, it is necessary to source two scripts:

	. /OSG/setup.sh
	. /OSG/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/ml_env

(replace "/OSG" with the path to your OSG directory)

If you have the LCG distribution it is not necessary to source any script.

To compile, just run the "comp" script from the modules' directory:

	./comp

To enable the modules you should add to the farm configuration file a line of 
the following form:

*<cluster_name>{moduleName, localhost, <arguments>}%<time_interval> 

where:
cluster_name - the cluster name for the results that this module produces
moduleName - name of module: monPN_Condor or monPN_PBS
<arguments> - list of arguments. The arguments that may be passed to the 
modules are presented below.


If the Statistics argument appears in the list of arguments, the module will 
provide an aditional "cluster" that contains statistics about number of nodes 
in the cluster.
For example:

	PN_PBS_LCG_Statistics
		|____Statistics
		     (parameters)
			|_____Total Nodes
			|_____Total Available Nodes
			|_____Total Down Nodes

Note: For the PN_LCG_Condor module the "Total Nodes" and "Total Down Nodes" may
have inaccurate values.

The Server argument indicates the name of PBS server / Condor central manager
that will be queried. For example:
	Server=lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro 
is a valid entry for this parameter. This argument is optional and it can 
appear more than once in the list; if it doesn't appear, the PBS server from 
the local machine will be used.

 The UseLocal argument is used to specify that the local PBS server / Condor 
central manager should be queried; this argument can be used together with one 
or more Server arguments (in this case, both the local server and the ones
given by the Server arguments will be queried).

 The RemoteHost argument is used to specify the IP or hostname of 
a remote host on which the commands will be issued instead of the local 
machine, via ssh. A username can also be given here (e.g., lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro
or monalisa@lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro are valid values for this parameter). 
ATTENTION! If you use this option, you must be able to connect to the remote
host with ssh without giving a password (e.g., you should use public key
authentication).

 The CanSuspend argument is a boolean one; if set to true, the module
is suspended for a period of time if it produces errors three times 
consecutively when it is run. By default, the value is false. Example:
	      CanSuspend=true	      

Examples:
	*PN_Condor{monPN_Condor, localhost}%120
	*PN_Condor{monPN_Condor, localhost, Statistics}%240
	*PN_Condor{monPN_Condor, localhost, UseLocal, Server=lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro}%60
	*PN_Condor{monPN_Condor, localhost, Server=lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro, CanSuspend=false}%80
	*PN_Condor{monPN_Condor, localhost, Server=lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro, Server=wn1.rogrid.pub.ro}%180


	

	

	*PN_PBS{monPN_PBS, localhost}%120
	*PN_PBS{monPN_PBS, localhost, Statistics}%120
	*PN_PBS{monPN_PBS, localhost, Server=lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro, CanSuspend=true}%90
	*PN_PBS{monPN_PBS, localhost, Statistics, Server=gw01.rogrid.pub.ro, server=lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro}%180
	*PN_PBS{monPN_PBS, localhost, UseLocal, Server=lcfg.rogrid.pub.ro}%90

Note: The verification of the parameter names for these modules is not case
sensitive (i.e., you can write "statistics" or "Statistics").

When the modules are run, there are some environment variables that should be
set, which indicate the location of the available queue managers:

- for PBS: if you have PBS, you should set the PBS_LOCATION variable; this
variable should be set such that the path to the pbsnodes command is
${PBS_LOCATION}/bin/pbsnodes.

- for Condor: if you have Condor, you should set the CONDOR_LOCATION variable; 
this variable should be set such that the path to the condor_status command is
${CONDOR_LOCATION}/bin/condor_status.

If you have the OSG distribuition and you sourced the OSG/setup.sh script,
all the needed variables are already set and it is not necessary to set any
other environment variables.

 3. Results Provided by the Modules
----------------------------------------

The parameters provided by the PN_Condor and PN_PBS  modules are:
 
    PN_Condor/PN_PBS
	|____node1
	|____node2
	|    (parameters)
	|	|____NoCPUs
	|	|____VIRT_MEM_free
	|	|____MEM_total
	|	|____Load1
	|......
	|____nodeN


where:
	- No_CPUs - the number of CPUs on the node
	- VIRT_MEM_free - the amount of free memory (physical + swap) in MB
	- MEM_total - the total amount of physical memory, in MB
	- Load1 - load average for 1 minute on the node

This is a simple MonALISA module to extract information from PBS

The two scripts ( compile and run_test) can be used to recompile the 
code and to test the module independently from MonaLISA
If the module works fine in your environment you can add it into 
the configuration file.

The module accepts an input parameter which is list of keywords 
(separated by",") in selection the jobs for which values are reported. 

e.g:
./run_test cmsim,test 


In this case the module will report about the jobs for which cmsim and
test strings appear in the job name. 

If no argument is provided, the module will report globally about the 
running and pending jobs
(./run_test) 

The module assumes that qstat is the path for th user from which 
MonALISA is used. 

You may change this, by editing the module. You will need to 
recompile it (./compile) 

For using the Module in MonLISA you need :
1) to add it into the configuration file :

*PBS-JOBS
>localhost
PBSjobs{cmsim,test}%30

A functional unit "PBS-JOBS" will be created, running on localhost 
and will report every 30s about the jobs having in the name the two 
specified strings 

If no arguments are passed  the line will be 
PBSjobs%30 


2) in ml.properties the ML classpath must include the PBS directory
   for loading the module 
e.g.:
lia.Monitor.CLASSURLs=file:${MonaLisa_HOME}/Service/usr_code/PBS/

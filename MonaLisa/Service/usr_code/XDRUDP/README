Use ./comp to compile and ./test_run to run XDRUDP module
standalone

In order to add it to ML:

1) add the following URL at the list of lia.Monitor.CLASSURLs
in ml.properties file

lia.Monitor.CLASSURLs=file:${MonaLisa_HOME}/Service/usr_code/XDRUDP/

 if you have more than one URLs please separate them by commas

lia.Monitor.CLASSURLs=file:${MonaLisa_HOME}/Service/usr_code/PBS/,file:${MonaLisa_HOME}/Service/usr_code/XDRUDP/

3) add the following line in myFarm.conf

^XDRUDP{ListenPort=8884}%10

4) You can add timeout on parameters/clusters/nodes to dissapear from the conf, if there is no data for them for
a specified ammount of time. You can also set a simple AccesConfFile in order to accept UDPs only for a specified
list of hosts, or set a simple password authentication scheme, or you can use both of them. If you want to append
to the node name the IP from where that data is sent, you can also use the flag AppendIPToNodeName.

The timeouts are in seconds!

^XDRUDP{AccessConfFile=/home/monalisa/MonaLisa/Service/usr_code/XDRUDP/XDRUDP.conf,ParamTimeout=200,NodeTimeout=300,ClusterTimeout=400,ListenPort=8884,AppendIPToNodeName=true}%10

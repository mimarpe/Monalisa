MonaLisa module. Interprets NetFlow V5 datagrams and reports traffic in and out between 
specified networks.

Configuration file format:
=========================
The NetFlow configuration file has the entries of the following format:
  
   -------------------
    Name
	type: M
        ipClass: 137.138.0.0/16	
   -------------------

"Name" is tha name you wish to give to this network.
Type is the entry type, Master (M) or Node (N). The traffic in and out parameters will
be calculated between the Master network and all the other Node networks specified. There 
also are raported a total traffic in and out parameters, as all traffic in and out for the
Master network.

Configuration file example:
   -------------------------
    Cern
	type: M
        ipClass: 137.138.0.0/16
	ipClass: 192.91.0.0/16
	
    Caltech 
    	type: N
	ipClass: 131.215.0.0/16
	
    FNAL 
	type: N
	ipClass: 131.225.0.0/16
	
    Total_IN: Cern
    Total_OUT: Starlight
    -------------------------
    
  This configuration file will raport traffic in and out between Cern(Master node) and Caltech and
  between Cern and FNAL. These parameters will be raported in cluster Netflow, node Cern_Caltech and 
  Cern_FNAL. Total traffic in and out parameters will be in cluster NetFlow, node Cern_Starlight, 
  as specified in the configuration file by entries Total_IN and Total_OUT. 
  
 Module Arguments:
 ================
  - port - port on the local machine where NetFlow datagrams are received from a router;
  - confFile - path to the NetFlow module configuration file;
  - samplerate - sample netflow rate of the router ;
  
  Example configuration line from myFarm.conf file:
    
   *NetFlow{NetFlowModule, localhost, port=2055,confFile=NetFlow.config,sampleRate=100}%30

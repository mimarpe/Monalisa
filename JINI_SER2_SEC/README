HOW TO START A LUS

Edit the variable JAVA_HOME (full path) in conf/set_env to point to your current JDK
PLEASE USE the latest stable version from Sun ( at least 1.4.1_02 )

1) Edit groups (param initialMemberGroups) under Services/LU_reggie/persistent/persistence.config

2) Go to scripts directory ( $cd scripts )

3) Init the Reggie keystore ($./init_LUS_keystore)

4) Import the CAs root certificates. ($./import_CA_cert <alias> <ca_cert.pem>)
   Only those Jini services started with a certificate signed by these CAs will be able to register in this LUS

5) Start the WebServer ($./jini_httpd start)

6) Start reggie ($./reggie_persistent start)

IMPORTANT
 Before you start reggie you must start the WebServer.

The logs for the WebServer and Reggie should be found in logs directory.

HOW TO STOP IT

1) stop reggie ( $cd scripts; ./reggie_persistent stop )
2) stop the WebServer ( $cd scripts; ./jini_httpd stop )

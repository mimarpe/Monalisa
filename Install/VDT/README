    MonaLisa for VDT
    ----------------

    This package contains a MonaLisa distribution for VDT.
    
    There are 4 files in this archive:
README : this file
install.sh : the install script you should run
install2.sh : this script is run by install.sh with the MonaLisa's user credentials
MonaLisa.v1.1.tar.gz : the MonaLisa main distribution file

    
    Install
    -------
    
    You can either use install.sh and follow the step-by-step procedure or you
can manually unpack the archive and configure yourself the MonALISA. If you want
to do the configuration yourself you can find documentation at:
    http://monalisa.cacr.caltech.edu/

    install.sh will check to see whether the user is root or not. If the user is
not root then install2.sh will be executed.
    If the user is root then it will be asked for an account from which MonaLisa 
will run. If the specified account does not exist then the script will attempt to
create one then it will copy the install2.sh and MonaLisa.v1.1.tar.gz in the users'
~/monalisa_install and will start install2.sh from there. After install2 finished
the ~/monalisa_install will be deleted.

    install2.sh will ask for the destination folder, unpack the MonaLisa.v1.1.tar.gz 
file and ask for the farm configuration options. One of the first options you have
to make is the farm name, this option defaults to the short hostname of the computer
but you have to make sure this name is unique in the MonaLisa environment. You will
also have to enter the Lat and Long of your server. You can find an aproximate value 
with http://geotags.com/


    Upgrade
    -------

    If the destination folder already contains an older MonaLisa installation then
all the configuration files are kept unchanged. In fact the CMD, TEST and VDTFarm 
folders remain untouched, which is bad if you run an older version of MonaLisa.
So if you want to upgrade from an older MonaLisa installation please choose another 
destination folder and then check if the newly generated configuration is correct.


    Running 
    -------

    After the install completes you can check the configuration by editing the 
following files:
  ML_HOME/Service/CMD/ml_env
  ML_HOME/Service/CMD/site_env
  ML_HOME/Service/VDTFarm/ml.properties
  ML_HOME/Service/VDTFarm/vdtFarm.conf
    
  In Service/CMD folder you have some usefull scripts :
ML_SER        - starts,stops or restarts the service
MLD           - to be put in init.d so you can control the service
CHECK_UPDATE  - should be put in crontab to automatically update the MonALISA

 For exporting global variables ( like VDT_LOCATION, GLOBUS_LOCATION ), please use
ML_HOME/Service/CMD/site_env.

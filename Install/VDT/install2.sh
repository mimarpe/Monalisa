#
######################## PORTS to be used ##############################
#
# This will allow to start the service according to the firewall policy
# TCP & UDP  ports used by MonaLisa.
#
#
# MonaLisa will try to bind a few ports ( actually 3 ) in a range between

# if you want a different community than public to intergate your nodes
# default the public community is used
#
#lia.Monitor.SNMP_community=public
#
#
# Port for SNMP queries
# Default is 161
#lia.Monitor.SNMP_port=1611

#########################################################################
## Wheter to use SNMP or not for MonaLisa to monitor itself
## it's better to be left as it is. If this parameter is set to true you
## should have SNMP running on the node that MonaLisa is started. For the self
## monitoring part we parse /proc files if this option is false.
## Default is false
#lia.monitor.Farm.use_SNMP=false

################## Web Services Settings ############################
##
## Wheter to start or not the Axis WebServer ( default false )
##
#lia.Monitor.startWSDL=false

##
##Port used for the WebService. Default is 6004
#lia.Monitor.wsdl_port=6004

##
## The URL for MLWebService will be
## http://<your_hostname>:<wsdl_port>/axis/services/MLWebService
##
## E.g: To get the WSDL for MLWebService from localhost you can try
## $wget http://localhost:6004/axis/services/MLWebService?wsdl
##

################ Store configuration ####################################
##
## There are three possible configurations.
## There are two embedded DB ( MySQL and McKOI )
##
## MonALISA will start by default using embedded DB for storing monitoring
## informations
##
## This is suitable for small sites. To keep a longer history, or run on a large
## cluster we recommend using a standalone MySQL with a larger cache size,
## instead of McKoi or embedded MySQL.
##
## To store the informations in MySQL please comment the line 
## lia.Monitor.jdbcDriverString=com.mckoi.JDBCDriver and uncomment
## lia.Monitor.jdbcDriverString = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
##
##
#lia.Monitor.jdbcDriverString=com.mckoi.JDBCDriver

#
## MySQL Embedded
##
## The flag lia.Monitor.use_emysqldb=true is the only one needed to start MonALISA
## with embedded MySQL
##
lia.Monitor.use_emysqldb=true

##
## McKOI
##
## If you would like MonALISA to start with embedded McKOI please comment the line
## lia.Monitor.use_emysqldb=true or set the flag to false
##
lia.Monitor.jdbcDriverString=com.mckoi.JDBCDriver

##
## How long to keep the data. Default ( 3 h = 10800 s)
##
#lia.Monitor.keep_history=10800

lia.Monitor.keep_history=10800

## The data collected from the monitoring modules can be stored in several
## tables, to allow users to interrogate it from their clients.
##
## These tables are defined below with the following parameters:
##
##    lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.web_writes = <nr_of_tables>
##
## For each of the <nr_of_tables> there are given several parameters:
##
##    lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.writer_N.total_time=<time in seconds>
##    lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.writer_N.samples=<number of values to be stored on this interval>
##    lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.writer_N.table_name=<table name, should be unique>
##    lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.writer_N.writemode=<write mode>
##
## where N is a number from 0 to <nr_of_tables>-1, and the parameters represent:
##
##  ..table_name : is the name of this table. This name should be unique.
##
##  ..writemode  : represents the way this table is used. There are 3 possibilities:
##             0 - write average values to this table, one for each total_time/samples
##                 seconds. The table will be used to store "double" values.
##             1 - write every value received, do not mediate the data. This also
##                 stores "double" values.
##             2 - the table will store any kind of data ( e.g. Strings ). The objects will only be stored
##                 since there is no way to know at this level how to compute the average
##                 for them.
##
##  ..total_time : is the interval, in SECONDS, for which this table stores data. Values
##                 older than this are removed from the table.
##
##  ..samples    : is the number of values to be stored in the table, on the specified
##                 interval. This parameter is only used if writemode is set to 0 (writemode=0),
##		   i.e. for having a fixed number of samples for averaged data. When write mode is 1 or 2
##                 the "samples" value is ignored, all the data that is received being
##                 stored into the database.
##
##  IMPORTANT: The tables must be defined from the one with smallest total_time to the
##             biggest total_time.
##
##
## IMPORTANT: The following values are ignored if lia.Monitor.jdbcDriverString=com.mckoi.JDBCDriver or
## if lia.Monitor.jdbcDriverString is not specified because MonALISA will use the embedded database and
## the only parameter that is considered is lia.Monitor.keep_history
##

## To save data into MySQL db just uncomment and fill the next lines
## with the right values.
##

#lia.Monitor.jdbcDriverString = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
#lia.Monitor.ServerName = 127.0.0.1
#lia.Monitor.DatabaseName = mon_data
#lia.Monitor.UserName = mon_user
#lia.Monitor.Pass = mon_pass
#lia.Monitor.DatabasePort = 3306

## how many tables are defined
lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.web_writes = 3

lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.writer_0.total_time=10800
lia.Monitor.Store.TransparentStoreFast.writer_0.table_name=monitor_s_3hour

# Configuration options for the Mckoi SQL Database.
#
# NOTE: Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
#######################################################

#
# database_path - The path where the database data files
#   are located.
#   See the 'root_path' configuration property for the
#   details of how the engine resolves this to an
#   absolute path in your file system.

database_path=MKDB/data

#
# log_path - The path the log files are written.
#   See the 'root_path' configuration property for the
#   details of how the engine resolves this to an
#   absolute path in your file system.
#   The log path must point to a writable directory.  If
#   no log files are to be kept, then comment out (or
#   remove) the 'log_path' variable.

log_path=MKDB/log

#
# root_path - If this is set to 'jvm' then the root
#   path of all database files is the root path of the
#   JVM (Java virtual machine) running the database
#   engine.  If this property is set to 'configuration'
#   or if it is not present then the root path is the
#   path of this configuration file.
#   This property is useful if you are deploying a
#   database and need this configuration file to be the
#   root of the directory tree of the database files.

root_path=configuration
#root_path=jvm

#
# jdbc_server_port - The TCP/IP port on this host where
#   the database server is mounted.  The default port
#   of the Mckoi SQL Database server is '9157'

jdbc_server_port=9157

#
# ignore_case_for_identifiers - If enabled all
#   identifiers are compared case insensitive.  If
#   disabled (the default) the case of the identifier
#   is important.
#   For example, if a table called 'MyTable' contains
#   a column called 'my_column' and this property is
#   enabled, the identifier 'MYTAble.MY_COlumN' will
#   correctly reference the column of the table.  If
#   this property is disabled a not found error is
#   generated.
#   This property is intended for compatibility with
#   other database managements systems where the case
#   of identifiers is not important.

ignore_case_for_identifiers=disabled

#
# socket_polling_frequency - Mckoi SQL maintains a pool
#   of connections on the server to manage dispatching
#   of commands to worker threads.  All connections on
#   the jdbc port are polled frequently, and ping
#   requests are sent to determine if the TCP
#   connection has closed or not.  This value determines
#   how frequently the connections are polled via the
#   'available' method.
#   The value is the number of milliseconds between each
#   poll of the 'available' method of the connections
#   input socket stream.  Different Java implementations
#   will undoubtedly require this value to be tweaked.
#   A value of '3' works great on the Sun NT Java 1.2.2
#   and 1.3 Java runtimes.
#
#   NOTE: This 'socket polling' module is a horrible hack
#   and will be removed at some point when the threading
#   performance improves or there is an API for non-
#   blocking IO.  I'll probably write an alternative
#   version for use with the improved Java version.

socket_polling_frequency=3




# ----- PLUG-INS -----

#
# database_services - The services (as a Java class) that
#   are registered at database boot time.  Each service
#   class is separated by a semi-colon (;) character.
#   A database service must extend
#   com.mckoi.database.ServerService
#
#database_services=mypackage.MyService

#
# function_factories - Registers one or more FunctionFactory
#   classes with the database at boot time.  A
#   FunctionFactory allows user-defined functions to be
#   incorporated into the SQL language.  Each factory class
#   is separated by a semi-colon (;) character.
#
#function_factories=mypackage.MyFunctionFactory

#
# The Java regular expression library to use.  Currently
# the engine supports the Apache Jakarta regular expression
# library, and the GNU LGPL regular expression library.
# These two regular expression libraries can be found at the
# following web sites:
#
# GNU Regexp: http://www.cacas.org/~wes/java/
# Apache Regexp: http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/
#
# The libraries provide similar functionality, however they
# are released under a different license.  The GNU library
# is released under the LGPL and is compatible with GPL
# distributions of the database.  The Apache Jakarta library
# is released under the Apache Software License and must not
# be linked into GPL distributions.
#
# Use 'regex_library=gnu.regexp' to use the GNU library, or
# 'regex_library=org.apache.regexp' to use the Apache
# library.
#
# NOTE: To use either library, you must include the
#  respective .jar package in the Java classpath.

regex_library=gnu.regexp




# ----- PERFORMANCE -----

#
# data_cache_size - The maximum amount of memory (in bytes)
#   to allow the memory cache to grow to.  If this is set
#   to a value < 4096 then the internal cache is disabled.
#   It is recommended that a database server should provide
#   a cache of 4 Megabytes (4194304).  A stand alone
#   database need not have such a large cache.

data_cache_size=8192

#
# max_cache_entry_size - The maximum size of an element
#   in the data cache.  This is available for tuning
#   reasons and the value here is dependant on the type
#   of data being stored.  If your data has more larger
#   fields that would benefit from being stored in the
#   cache then increase this value from its default of
#   8192 (8k).

max_cache_entry_size=8192

#
# lookup_comparison_list - When this is set to 'enabled'
#   the database attempts to optimize sorting by generating
#   an internal lookup table that enables the database to
#   quickly calculate the order of a column without having
#   to look at the data directly.  The column lookup
#   tables are only generated under certain query
#   conditions.  Set this to 'disabled' if the memory
#   resources are slim.

lookup_comparison_list=enabled

#
# lookup_comparison_cache_size - The maximum amount of
#   memory (in bytes) to allow for column lookup tables.
#   If the maximum amount of memory is reached, the lookup
#   table is either cached to disk so that is may be
#   reloaded later if necessary, or removed from memory
#   entirely.  The decision is based on how long ago the
#   table was last used.
#
#   This property only makes sense if the
#   'lookup_comparison_list' property is enabled.
#
# NOTE: This property does nothing yet...

lookup_comparison_cache_size=2097152

#
# index_cache_size - The maximum amount of memory (in
#   bytes) to allow for the storage of column indices.
#   If the number of column indices in memory reaches
#   this memory threshold then the index blocks are
#   cached to disk.
#
# ISSUE: This is really an implementation of internal
#   memory page caching but in Java.  Is it necessary?
#   Why not let the OS handle it with its page file?
#
# NOTE: This property does nothing yet...

index_cache_size=2097152

#
# max_worker_threads - The maximum number of worker
#   threads that can be spawned to handle incoming
#   requests.  The higher this number, the more
#   'multi-threaded' the database becomes.  The
#   default setting is '4'.

maximum_worker_threads=4

#
# soft_index_storage - If this is set to 'enabled', the
#   database engine will keep all column indices behind a
#   soft reference.  This enables the JVM garbage collector
#   to reclaim memory used by the indexing system if the
#   memory is needed.
#
#   This is useful for an embedded database where requests
#   are rare.  When the database part is idle, the index 
#   memory (that can take up significant space for large
#   tables) is reclaimed for other uses.  For a dedicated
#   database server it is recommended this is disabled.
#
#   Enable this if you need the engine to use less memory.
#   I would recommend the config property
#   'lookup_comparison_list' is disabled if this is enabled.
#   The default setting is 'disabled'.

soft_index_storage=disabled

#
# dont_synch_filesystem - If this is enabled, the engine
#   will not synchronize the file handle when a table change
#   is committed.  This will mean the data is not as
#   safe but the 'commit' command will work faster.  If this
#   is enabled, there is a chance that committed changes will
#   not get a chance to flush to the file system if the
#   system crashes.
#
#   It is recommended this property is left commented out.
#
dont_synch_filesystem=enabled

#
# transaction_error_on_dirty_select - If this is disabled
#   the 4th conflict (dirty read on modified table) will
#   not be detected.  This has transactional consequences
#   that will cause data modifications to sometimes be
#   out of syncronization.  For example, one transaction
#   adds an entry, and another concurrent transaction
#   deletes all entries.  If this is disabled this
#   conflict will not be detected.  The table will end up
#   with the one entry added after commit.
#
#   It is recommended this property is left commented out.
#
#transaction_error_on_dirty_select=disabled








# ----- SPECIAL -----

#
# read_only - If this is set to 'enabled' then the database
#   is readable and not writable.  You may boot a database
#   in read only mode from multiple VM's.  If the database
#   data files are stored on a read only medium such as a
#   CD, then the property must be enabled else it will not
#   be possible to boot the database.
#   ( Uncomment the line below for read only mode )
#read_only=enabled




# ----- DEBUGGING -----

#
# debug_log_file - The file that is used to log all debug
#   information.  This file is stored in the 'log_path'
#   path.

debug_log_file=debug.log

#
# debug_level - The minimum debug level of messages that
#   are written to the log file.  Reducing this number
#   will cause more debug information to be written to
#   the log.
#     10 = INFORMATION
#     20 = WARNINGS
#     30 = ALERTS
#     40 = ERRORS

debug_level=20

#
# table_lock_check - If this is enabled, every time a
#   table is accessed a check is performed to ensure that
#   the table owns the correct locks.  If a lock assertion
#   fails then an error is generated in the log file.
#   This should not be enabled in a production system
#   because the lock assertion check is expensive. However
#   it should be used during testing because it helps to
#   ensure locks are being made correctly.

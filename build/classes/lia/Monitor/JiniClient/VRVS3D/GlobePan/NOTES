The Earth is given a radius of 1.0. Everything else should be sized accordingly.

If you try to make the Mmap the topmost tab, with the GlobePan underneath,
the 3D scene will initially be rendered over the Mmap panel. The solution:
set up the application with the GlobePan on top by default, or manually
call setSelectedComponent() on the TabbedPane component holding the panels.

The texture for the globe can be changed at the command line by setting the
"lia.Monitor.JiniClient.VRVS3D.globeTexture" property. The texture must be
an image of a well-known type (i.e. jpg, gif, etc.) and both its width and
height must be powers of 2 (this restriction is imposed by Java 3D).

The Earth is given a radius of 1.0. Everything else should be sized accordingly.

If you try to make the Mmap the topmost tab, with the GlobePanel3D underneath,
the 3D scene will initially be rendered over the Mmap panel. The solution:
set up the application with the GlobePanel3D on top by default, or manually
call setSelectedComponent() on the TabbedPane component holding the panels.
